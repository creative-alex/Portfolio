      <p>Hi, I'm Alex! As a frontend developer, I'm passionate about building websites and web applications that create meaningful experiences for users.
      <br>
      While I have less than a year of experience, I'm a quick learner and I'm constantly expanding my skill set.
      Currently learning how to use frameworks like React and Bootstrap to create dynamic and engaging user interfaces.
      I'm excited to take on new challenges and continue growing as a frontend developer. 
      <br>
      Let's collaborate and create something great!</p>
